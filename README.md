## Introduction

The Road Casualty Statistics Analysis project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict the severity of road casualties based on various factors such as age, gender, location, and vehicle type. By understanding the underlying patterns in road accidents, this project aims to contribute to the development of preventive measures and safety interventions.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess road casualty data to prepare it for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis: Visualize and explore the relationships between different variables in the dataset.
- Machine learning models: Train and evaluate logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost, and neural network models for predicting casualty severity.
- Model evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Documentation: Provide detailed documentation on installation, usage, and contributing to the project.

## Installation

To run the Road Casualty Statistics Analysis project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/khashayarM7/Road-Accidents-Data-2022.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd road-casualty-analysis`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
5. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to execute the analysis.

## Usage

To analyze road casualty statistics and train machine learning models, follow these steps:

1. Load the dataset: Import the road casualty dataset and preprocess it using pandas and NumPy.
2. Exploratory data analysis: Visualize missing values, distribution of variables, and relationships between features.
3. Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train machine learning models: Use logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost, and neural network algorithms to predict casualty severity.
5. Evaluate model performance: Generate classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves to assess the performance of each model.
6. Hyperparameter tuning: Use GridSearchCV to optimize model hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
